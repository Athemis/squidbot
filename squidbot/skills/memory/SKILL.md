# Memory

**`## Your Memory`** — Your global cross-session notes (MEMORY.md). Injected into every
system prompt when non-empty. Write to it with `memory_write`. Persists across all sessions.

**`## Session Summary`** — Auto-generated by the system. You cannot write to it.

## Using `memory_write`

Call it proactively when you learn something worth keeping across sessions: user preferences,
ongoing projects, key facts, things the user asks you to remember.

Do **not** use it for ephemeral context (current task state, things already in MEMORY.md,
session-only information).

The tool **replaces** the entire document. Always:
1. Read `## Your Memory` from the system prompt.
2. Merge new info in — never lose existing facts.
3. Keep under ~300 words. Prefer bullet points.
