# Memory Skill

## What you have

**`## Your Memory` (global MEMORY.md)** — Your personal, cross-session notes. Injected
into every system prompt when non-empty, so you see it on every turn. You write to it
using the `memory_write` tool. Persists forever across all sessions.

**`## Session Summary`** — Auto-generated by the system when conversation history grows
long. Summarises earlier parts of this session so you can still reference them. You do
*not* write to this — the system manages it automatically.

## When to use `memory_write`

Use it **proactively** when you learn something that should persist to future sessions:

- User preferences ("prefers concise answers", "uses vim", "works in Berlin timezone")
- Ongoing projects ("building a Rust CLI tool called `ripdb`")
- Key facts about the user or their setup
- Things the user explicitly asks you to remember

Do **not** call `memory_write` for:
- Information relevant only to the current session
- Ephemeral task context ("we're currently debugging function X")
- Things already in MEMORY.md

## How to use `memory_write`

The tool **replaces** the entire MEMORY.md. Always:

1. Read the current `## Your Memory` section from the system prompt.
2. Merge new information in — do not lose existing facts.
3. Keep the document under ~300 words. Prefer bullet points over prose.
4. Write clean Markdown.

Example call:

```json
{
  "content": "## User Profile\n- Name: Alex\n- Works in Berlin (UTC+1)\n- Prefers concise, direct answers\n\n## Ongoing Projects\n- `ripdb` — Rust CLI debugger, repo at ~/git/ripdb\n"
}
```

## What NOT to do

- Do not write ephemeral session context to MEMORY.md (clutters future sessions).
- Do not let MEMORY.md grow unboundedly — trim stale facts when adding new ones.
- Do not confuse `## Your Memory` (your notes) with `## Session Summary` (system-generated).
